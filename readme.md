# Active learning for Graph neural networks (AL4GNN)
A scalable active learning framework for GNN tasks on Large graphs.

## Folder structure

### data
processed graphs: edge weights-influence probability, node features, node lables.

### src
Contain all script files

### models
1. Trained node classification (candidiate node identiifcation) pytorch models.\

Note: There are other files that are developed on fly but are not needed for the output generation.
